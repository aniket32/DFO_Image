'''
TASKS:
	Use this code as a guide for simple image analysis.
	
	1- Update the DFO code to find the brightest area in the input image.
	2- Try the code for other input images
	3- Change input image half-way through and see if your algorithm can perform

ADVANCED TASKS:
	4- Is it possible to trace a moving object? 
	5- How about tracing gradually fading and emerging objects?
	6- What if the input image has two or more bright spots?
	7- If the task was to find symmetry in an image, what would be your fitness function?
